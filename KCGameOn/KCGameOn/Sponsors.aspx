			We are a non-profit LAN that puts on six events per year since 2005 averaging around 140 people per event in 2014.  We provide gaming areas for all types of gaming - PC, Console, Boardgames, Card games (holdem, magic:the gathering, etc) and anything else folks want to play.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Every LAN we give away between 4-8 door prizes and <b><U>we need your help!</u></b>  LAN events are only as good as service/prizes/food/drink they can provide.
		</p>
		<p>
            Sponsorship can come in many forms!  We ask that you consider donating whatever financial support, product or any other kind of cross promotion you have available.
		</p>

			In exchange for your support, we can promote your company or product in many different ways.  At a minimum, we <b>always thank our sponsors</b> after dinner when we give away our door prizes for the evening.
